## ⚙️ Worker Registry

**Location**: `src/workers/index.ts`

The worker registry imports and exports all active workers. It does NOT import deprecated or disabled workers.

**Active Imports**:
```typescript
// V1 Core
export { default as autoCancelJobs } from './v1-core/autoCancelJobs';
export { default as autoExpireAwaitingApproval } from './v1-core/autoExpireAwaitingApproval';
// ... etc

// V2 Operations
export { default as creditEconomyMaintenance } from './v2-operations/creditEconomyMaintenance';
// ... etc

// V3 Automation
export { default as subscriptionJobs } from './v3-automation/subscriptionJobs';

// V4 Analytics
export { default as expireBoosts } from './v4-analytics/expireBoosts';
// ... etc

// Reliability
export { default as reliabilityRecalc } from './reliability/reliabilityRecalc';
// ... etc
```

**Note**: Deprecated and disabled workers are NOT exported.

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before Enabling Deprecated Workers:
1. Check if superseded by a newer worker
2. Review code for outdated logic
3. Test in staging first
4. Update worker registry if re-enabling

### Adding New Workers:
1. Place in appropriate version folder
2. Update `index.ts` registry
3. Add npm script in `package.json`
4. Document in `WORKER_SCHEDULE.md`
5. Update this status doc

### Modifying Workers:
1. Check if worker is actually used
2. Test with dry-run script first
3. Update documentation
4. Consider impact on other workers
